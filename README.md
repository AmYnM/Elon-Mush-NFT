# Elon Musk NFT Smart Contract on OpenSea

This project involves the deployment of a custom NFT (Non-Fungible Token) smart contract named `ElonNFT`, which mints NFTs and is integrated with OpenSea for trading. It is built using the Solidity programming language, Hardhat for testing and deployment, and the Ethers.js library to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.

# Project


## Features

- **Solidity Smart Contract:** The `Elon.sol` contract defines the NFT.
- **Deployment Script:** `run.js` is used to deploy the contract and mint NFTs.
- **OpenSea Integration:** Once the NFT is minted, it can be listed and traded on OpenSea.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v14+)
- **NPM** or **Yarn**
- **Hardhat**: For smart contract development and testing.

```bash
npm install --save-dev hardhat
```

## Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ElonMuskNFT.git
cd ElonMuskNFT
```

## Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

## Setup Environment Variables
Create a .env file at the root of your project to store your private keys and other sensitive information.
```bash
API_KEY=<Your_Alchemy_or_Infura_Key>
PRIVATE_KEY=<Your_Wallet_Private_Key>
```

## Compile the Smart Contract
```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

## Deploy the Smart Contract
Run the run.js script to deploy the NFT contract and mint your NFTs.
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/run.js
```
After deployment, the contract address will be printed in the console. You can also mint NFTs by using the same script.
```bash
Elon contract address is: 0xYourContractAddressHere
Yay... NFT minted successfully!!!
```

## Contract Deployment Example
```bash
async function main() {
  const deployNFTContract = await ethers.deployContract("ElonNFT");
  console.log("Deploying Contract...");

  const elon = await deployNFTContract.waitForDeployment();
  console.log("Elon contract address is:", await elon.getAddress());

  console.log("Minting NFT...");
  let txn = await elon.mintNFT();
  await txn.wait();

  console.log("Yay... NFT minted successfully!!!");
}
```

## Testing
```bash
npx hardhat test
```
